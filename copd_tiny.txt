The progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated
with marked alterations in circulating immune cell populations, but no studies
have characterized alterations in these cell types across the full spectrum of
lung function impairment in current and former smokers. In 6,299 subjects from
the COPDGene and ECLIPSE studies, we related Coulter blood counts and proportions
to cross-sectional FEV1 adjusting for current smoking status. We also related
cell count measures to three-year change in FEV1 in ECLIPSE subjects. In a subset
of subjects with blood gene expression data, we used cell type deconvolution
methods to infer the proportions of immune cell subpopulations, and we related
these to COPD clinical status. We observed that FEV1 levels are positively
correlated with lymphocytes and negatively correlated with myeloid populations
such as neutrophils and monocytes. In multivariate models, cell counts and
proportions were significantly associated with FEV1. We also observed that
lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophil counts were predictive of three year
change in lung function. Using cell type deconvolution to study immune cell
subpopulations, we observed that subjects with COPD had a lower proportion of
CD4+ resting memory cells and naive B cells compared to non-COPD smokers.
Alterations in circulating immune cells in COPD support a mixed pattern of
lymphocyte suppression and an enhanced myeloid cell immune response. Cell counts 
and proportions contribute independent information to models predicting lung
function suggesting a critical role for immune response in long-term COPD
outcomes. Cell type deconvolution is a promising method for immunophenotyping in 
large cohorts.

Rationale Characterizing the dynamic nature of post-hospital risk in COPD is
needed to provide counseling and plan clinical services. Objectives To analyze
risk of readmission and death among Medicare beneficiaries >=65 years following
discharge for COPD, and to determine the association between ventilator support
and risk trajectory. Methods We computed daily absolute risks of hospital
readmission and death for one year after discharge for COPD, stratified by
ventilator support. We determined the time required for risks to decline 50% from
maximum daily values after discharge; and for daily risks to plateau. We compared
risks with those found in the general elderly population. Measurements and Main
Results Among 2,340,637 hospitalizations, the readmission rate at 1 year was
64.2%, including 63.5%, 66.0% and 64.1% among those receiving invasive,
noninvasive and no ventilation. Among 1,283,069 hospitalizations, mortality at 1 
year was 26.2%, including 45.7%, 41.8% and 24.4% among those same groups. Daily
risk of readmission declined by 50% within 28, 39 and 43 days, and plateaued in
46, 54, and 61 days among those receiving invasive, noninvasive and no
ventilation, respectively. Risk of death declined by 50% by 3, 4 and 17 days, and
plateaued by 21, 18, and 24 days. Risks of hospitalization and death were
significantly higher following discharge for COPD compared to the general
Medicare population. Conclusions Discharge from hospital is associated with
prolonged risks of readmission and death that vary with need for ventilator
support. Interventions limited to the first month after discharge may be
insufficient to improve longitudinal outcomes.
